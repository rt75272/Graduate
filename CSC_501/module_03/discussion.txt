Agile Influence 

Changing the scope of a project happens. Traditional approaches may be resistant to change due to the lack of 
flexibility. Since agile is more flexible with its sprints, an agile approach is able to adapt and embrace the change. 
Furthermore, since traditional methods are not very adaptable this can lead to further delays or scope creep. Whereas,
agile methods are able to scale each sprint in order to efficiently minimize any delays.

With an example project, the requirements and deliverables are essentially stationary and do not change much. With agile 
the project can be reassessed after change time block or sprint. At which point the project's requirements and/or deliverables
can be altered in order to adapt to the new scope and sequencing.
