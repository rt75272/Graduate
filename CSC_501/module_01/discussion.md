Agile VS Traditional

A traditional approach such as the waterfall method has been a simple method that works, however, the 
agile method can improve the process. Agile can seem a bit more complicated at the start but the benefits 
greatly improve a development process, especially working in a team.

__Iterative:__ A traditional approach includes a more linear and basic approach to building a project. 
Agile prefers to have a iterative approach. The iterative approach allows more room for corrections and 
embrace changes of direction. 

__Collaboration:__ Greater collaboration is another benefit of the agile method. Agile incorporates everyone 
on the team with nearly every step. Whereas, a traditional approach will be more isolating for the developers 
working on a specific part of a project.  

__Continuous Integration:__ Continuous integration is another key point of the Agile process. Traditional 
approaches will often not improve their product as much once it is completed. Possibly leading to more issues 
and the boring lack of updates to the product. Agile will use continuous integration to constantly fix and
update the product. Which is just another way agile is more flexible than traditional methods. 

An example project could be a website where a team implements the agile methodology. The team could 
break up the website into user stories which will then be placed into tasks on a Kanban board. Kanban 
boards can be a useful way to see where everyone is at with their portion of the project. Kanban boards 
are also a useful way to break up the project into smaller more manageable pieces. Furthermore, the team 
would conduct sprints where each team member completes a small portion. Once the sprint is over, that 
iteration of project will come together into a completed version of the project, or at the very least, a 
good chuck of a version will be complete. Once a completed version of the website is complete the website 
will not be left alone. The website will get constant updates and fixes with every iteration. Continuous 
integration will continue until the end of the website's life cycle.Â
