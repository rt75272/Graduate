# Design and Implementation of a Project Management API using Python and Blockchain Technology

I was having trouble selecting a topic to work on during the time of this course. Therefore, I chose from the
provided list of ideas. The Design and Implementation of a Project Management API using Python and Blockchain 
Technology seemed to pop out at me. I am not sure if we will be implementing the project or just focusing on the 
development process of the project but I would always love to learn more about blockchain. However, I would still
enjoy setting up the development process for such a project. I would like to start setting up a Kanban board for 
this project. Kanban boards might be the most useful part of the development process for me.
