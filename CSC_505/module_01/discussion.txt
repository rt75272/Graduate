Is the definition adequate?
Definition: Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the non-tangible component of computers, encompassing applications, operating systems, utilities, and more.

I believe the definition is adequate due to describing how software is the non-tangible instructions, data, or programs used to operate computer hardware. Thus, suggesting that computer hardware is useless without computer software. 

What is missing?
The definition could be a little more specific with what software development and tasks actually entails. For example, software could be the AI assistant built into your computer, tablet, or smart phone.

Why is it difficult to define software?
Given the nature of being non-tangible makes it difficult to describe exactly what it is because it almost requires some imagination to picture it in one’s head.

Does this definition keep in mind best practices of software development?
The definition does not specify the best practices or really the development process. It simply gives an overview of what software is rather than how it works.
