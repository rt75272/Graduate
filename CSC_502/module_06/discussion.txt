Chevrolet has their own self driving technology called Super Cruise. Super Cruise allows the driver  to be hands free while the car is driving itself. The technology includes automatic lane changes and a trailering feature for towing. However the hands free feature needs to be on compatible roads. The Chevrolet website has a map of the compatible roads, which comes to a total of 189,032,349 miles. The compatible roads are there due to safety. The compatible roads essentially keep the car on a type of track. Chevrolet wanted to make sure the self driving feature is used safely on approved roads. Therefore, the self driving feature may not allow the driver to go just anywhere, however, it does keep the driver safe while using the self driving feature. This could be an example of ethical egoism where Chevrolet did what was in their self interest and came out with the compatible roads in order protect themselves from potential lawsuits, while also attempting to keep drivers safe.
