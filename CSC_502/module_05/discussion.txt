AI adoption should not be taken lightly. With how powerful AI potentially could be, there ought to be some type of risk assessment to better understand what we are dealing with. A risk assessment would get us on the right track with setting up regulation. Until we fully understand the impacts of AI there should be rigorous regulation. That way there is a smoother start to the mass adoption on AI in nearly every industry and aspect of life. Once, the mass adoption takes place, we will be able to find parts of regulation the may not be needed and thus removed.
