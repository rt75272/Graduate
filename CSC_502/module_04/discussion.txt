People posting about their own health issues can lead to HIPAA violations. The data could leak out into other areas of the internet and spread. Then the health information ends up in the hands of those who shouldn't ever see it. Thus, violating HIPAA rules. To avoid spreading personal health information, people should not be posting anything they don’t want all over the internet because data leaks do and will happen.  

Another way social media can compromise protect health information is from employees. Employees working at a hospital may post innocent pictures without realizing what is in the photo. 
For example, there could be a patients name and information on a small piece of paper in the background. You may not see it easily but zooming in on the photo will fix that. Therefore, someone’s innocent selfie ends up being a HIPAA violation due to information hiding in the background. 

In order to mitigate the problem people really need to avoid posting on social media all together. Especially about their health information or when they are at the hospital. Whether or not you are working at the hospital you could spread personal health information through social media posts. Another option to help mitigate the problem would be to have training sessions for employees. That way employees are taught what is acceptable and what is not acceptable to post on social media.
