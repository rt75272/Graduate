	“AI systems are becoming a part of everyday life. The key is to ensure that these machines are aligned with human intentions and values” [1]. As AI integrates itself into our everyday lives we need to make sure the proper safety measurements are taken. AI has the potential to innovate nearly every industry. Some even consider AI to be the next industrial revolution [2]. Unfortunately, AI comes with a serious risk of misuse. Therefore, before AI advances too far we need to setup a baseline for the ethical use of AI. 
	Some elements which could help with AI safety includes transparency, a kill switch, avoiding bias, and AI safety teams. Transparent development of AI allows the public to see what AI is currently doing. Plus, transparency allows greater collaboration amongst the community. Which can help with safe development of the advanced technology. However, even with safe development of AI, undesirable and unforeseen events could still happen. Therefore, a type of kill switch could be put in place incase AI starts producing unfavorable results. That way the potential negative impacts can be avoided or at least minimized. Another element of AI safety to consider is avoiding bias. Take for example, facial recognition. Facial recognition has been notoriously bad at correctly identifying darker skin [3]. Thus having a bias towards lighter skin. This could be due to a number of reasons, but its certainly a negative bias that needs to be fixed. 
	An interesting measure OpenAI is taking to ensure safe development of AI is having AI safety teams [1]. OpenAI has teams that are solely focused on the safe ethical development of AI. Their teams address important problems such as finding ways to detect unknown and harmful answers, actions or usage. Thus attempting to solve the problems with AI development before they spiral out of control. In fact, OpenAI has a section of their website devoted to AI safety.
